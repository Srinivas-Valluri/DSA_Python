Greedy Algorithm:
  -In each step we will select the best possible value at that time.
  -We select the best solution at that time and freeze it and never come back to it again.
  -It is an algorithmic paradigm that builds the solution piece by piece.
  -Greedy can always not give optimal solution.
    Ex:-(Failure of Greedy)
      denominations = [1,3,4]. Return minimum number of coins for amount 6.
      Greedy: 4,1,1
      dp: 3,3
