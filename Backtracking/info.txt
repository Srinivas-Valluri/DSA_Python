Backtracking(follows DFS):
  -It is an algorithm that consider all the cases by brute-force for finding the desired output.
  -Recursion Intensive.
  -It is much better than brute-force because it can eliminate few candidates.
  -Brute Force:
    -Backtracking: Used to check all solutions.
    -Dynamic Programming: Used to find best solution(Optimization Problem).

  -Three types of problems in Backtracking:
    -Decision Problem - Search for a feasible solution.
    -Optimization Problem - Search for best solution.
    -Enumeration - find all feasible solutions.

  -We can represent problem in form of State Space Tree then we can check all solutions and eliminate few. We search this tree in DFS fashion.

  -Three steps for backtracking:
    -Checks weather the node is valid or not.
    -Discard several invalid solutions with one iteration. This we will do by Bounding Function.
    -Enumerate all subtree of the node to find the valid solution.  


Branch and Bound(follows BFS):
  - This is also brute force but the tree generated is level wise.
