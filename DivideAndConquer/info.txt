Divide and Conquer Algorithm:
  -It is an algorithm paradigm which works by recursively breaking down a problem into subproblems or similar types, until these become simple enough to be solved directly.
  -The solution of the subproblem are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.

Property of Divide and Conquire Algorithm:
  -If any problem's overall optimal solution can be constructed from the optimal solution of its subproblem then this problem has optimal substructure.
  This is called Optimal Substructure.

example: Fibonacii series, merge sort, quick sort, binary search.
