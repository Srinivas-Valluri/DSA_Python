BST Properties:
- In the left subtree the value of a node is less than or equal to its parent nodes value.
- In the right subtree the values of a node is greater than its parent nodes value.

Why BST?
- A BST doesn't store the index of data elements instead it relais on implicit structure to perform faster insertion and deletinon.
