-Definition:
A tree is a nonlinear data strcture with hierarchical relationships between its elements without having any cycle.
It is basically reversed from a real life tree.

-Properties:
Represents hierarchical data
Every node value and reference to sub-category

-Why a Tree?
Quicker access to data.
hierarchical data like folder strcture, organisation strcture etc..
There are many tree data structures which performs better in various situations. Binary Search Tree, AVL, Red Black Tree, Trie.

-Tree Terminology:
  -Root: top node without parent.
  -Edge: link between parent and child.
  -Leaf: a node which does not have children.
  -Sibling: children of same parent.
  -Ancestor: parent, grandparent... of a node.
  -Depth of node: a length of the path from root to node.
  -Height of node:a length of the path from the node to the deepest node.
  -Depth of Tree: depth of root node = 0.
  -Height of Tree: height of root node.

-Binary Tree
Each node has atmost two children.
binary tree is a family of data strcture(BST, Heap tree, AVL, red black tree, Syntax tree)
Huffman coding problem, heap priority problem and expression parsing problem can be solved efficiently using binary tree.

-Types of Binary Tree:
  -Full Binary Tree: 0 or 2 children
  -Perfect Binary Tree: All non-leaf nodes have 2 children
  -Complete Binary Tree: All levels are completely filled except the last one.
  -Balanced Binary Tree: all leaf nodes are located at the same distance from the root.

Binary Tree:
  -Linked List: Node will have three components(data, right, left). 
  -Pyhton List:
    - Index 0 is left empty to make calculations easy.
    - Root is kept at index 1.
    - Left Child = cell[2*x] - x is index of root
    - Right Child = cell[2*x+1] - x is index of root
    - We need to know the number of nodes in the tree to create fixed size of List.

Traversal of Binary Tree:
- Depth first Search (Time: O(n), space: O(n))
   - PreOrder - Root->left->right
   - InOrder - left->Root->Right
   - PostOrder - left->Right->Root
- Breadth first Search
  - Level Order Traversal
